## Overview

With the exception of the initial files (flowchart, icon, logo and style.css), I coded all lines myself by hand, following along the course whenever I got stuck, but making sure to code myself to tackle the challenge and learn.

## My process

I mainly followed along the instructor's code, with the exceptions of:

- Prettier config (I prefer double quotes);
- Some variables have a different name (like formattedmov's params), and I only used arrow functions when they were one liners.

### Built with

- VS Code (enhanced with Prettier and Path Intellisense extensions)
- Nodejs (v18.17.1) + live-server node app.

### What I learned

DOM manipulations, setInterval, Intl formatting, and hands-on implementations of a rudementary login system.

### Continued development

I'm eager to learn async functions and some more CSS in the future.
